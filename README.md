I recently thought of creating a SuDoKu game using JavaScript. Having played the classic game and enjoyed it in the past, I did not think of how complex the process of generating an instance of a game would be in the beginning. I quickly realized even after generating the random completed state successfully, creating a solvable puzzle with a unique solution is a huge challenge.

I have so far set up a board with random complete states in this CodeSandbox https://codesandbox.io/s/sudoku-wjo1fs
